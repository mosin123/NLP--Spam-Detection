#First Commit# NLP--Spam-Detection

We'll be using a dataset from the UCI datasets (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection)! This dataset is already located in the folder.

The file we are using contains a collection of more than 5 thousand SMS phone messages. You can check out the readme file(smsspamcollection\readme) for more info.
we'll train a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between ham/spam automatically. Then, with a trained model, we'll be able to classify arbitrary unlabeled messages as ham or spam
